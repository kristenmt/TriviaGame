<h1>Music Trivia Game</h1>

 I created a trivia game form with multiple choice questions. The theme is "Music". The player is only allowed to select 1 option, and has a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. The quiz game is completed when the clock runs out OR when the player clicks the "Done" button. The computer will then tally up and reveal the number of correct and incorrect answers, as well as how many questions were left unanswered.
